Yesterday I held a talk at OTS (Open Tech School) conf in Dortmund. It was my first time speaking at a conference and from what I have heard, I did good. After the talk, I opened my Twitter and had 14 unread mentions which [really](https://twitter.com/lhawthorn/status/632462379910070272) [wondered](https://twitter.com/anomiseditrix/status/632463527316426752) [me](https://twitter.com/rmehner/status/632463630601179136) [and](https://twitter.com/lhawthorn/status/632463683306811392) [they](https://twitter.com/hirojin/status/632463774381928448) [were](https://twitter.com/pascalweiland/status/632471490903019520) [all](https://twitter.com/Althaire/status/632466301601058816) [very](https://twitter.com/senorhuidobro/status/632466620087169024) [positive](https://twitter.com/lhawthorn/status/632467430065991680). Thanks everybody!

### Friday

I arrived Friday afternoon and had a really warm welcome by [Ola](https://github.com/zoepage/), one of the conference‚Äôs organisers. Friday night we had a speaker dinner which was really great. I have not met anyone in person yet but everyone was open minded and very kind. It was just awesome to meet everyone and we had great conversions, thank you!

### Saturday

I was glad to be the second person to speak. Talks were scheduled to be 20 minutes but I finished mine after 15 minutes. Better too short than too long.

Otherwise it went fine and I was less nervous than I expected to be. This was because of the great evening Friday night. People were so friendly and told me that it was just great that I want to speak and if something goes wrong everyone would understand. This gave me much self confidence, so thank you everyone!

### Slides

[You can find my slides at SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/jonicious/you-decide-whether-people-are-able-to-use-the-web). Because SpeakerDeck only supports pdf files, [here is a link to the .keynote file](/images/talk-otsconf.key). (To be honest, my talk is just as half as good without gifs.)

### Sunday

Saturday was the day of workshops. [Dan Callahan](https://twitter.com/callahad) & [Istv√°n Szmozs√°nszky](https://twitter.com/slsoftworks) held a [workshop about Firefox OS, Tessel 2 and Rust](http://www.meetup.com/de/opentechschool-dortmund/events/223912144/) which I really enjoyed. [Pascal Weiland](https://twitter.com/pascalweiland) and I built a little app for Firefox OS that shows a random gif which you can share via NFC. Unfortunately, the NFC part is buggy and does not work properly. <s>I am sure, we will fix this.</s>

I was really impressed when they said we can keep the phones. Thank you very much!

Before the talk of [Dan Callahan](https://twitter.com/callahad) & [Istv√°n Szmozs√°nszky](https://twitter.com/slsoftworks) on Saturday, I never thought, Firefox OS is actually cool. It is completely built in HTML, Javascript and CSS, so you are able to debug it easily or change the style of the OS just by editing some CSS. Furthermore, building apps for it is fun as you can use your web development knowledge. [Dan](https://twitter.com/callahad) said they are building it to see which functionalities and APIs are missing in Javascript to develop them.

By following this approach, they are pushing the web forwards. They discuss solutions with other browser manufactors and W3C and hopefully those will also adopt more technologies and we will all win with a more standardized web with more possibilities.

### Thank you!

To all the organisers and people involved in making OTS conf: Thank you! It was a pleasure!

I can only recommend going to conferences. You will meet many great people and learn a lot. If you have something to talk about, even better. Contribute and share your knowledge!
